Mansion Murders: Who Is Suspect Daron Dylon Wint?\\n                The school year was winding down, which meant Savvas and Amy Savopoulos were looking forward to extra family time with their three kids&#x2014;and, as many parents do, they couldn&#x2019;t help but note how quickly the children were growing up. At a recent get-together with friends, &#x201C;we talked about how the kids are getting big,&#x201D; says family friend Jami Fireman. The couple&#x2019;s oldest daughter, 19-year-old Abigail, was set to graduate from high school in a few weeks, and their youngest child, 10-year-old Philip, was finishing fourth grade. &#x201C;We were sitting outside, talking about summer plans,&#x201D; adds Fireman. &#x201C;No one seemed stressed at all.&#x201D; Philip, a polite boy who had recently begun racing Go-Karts, was recovering from a concussion, &#x201C;so he was taking it easy,&#x201D; she adds. &#x201C;He was telling me he wanted to be a race car driver. He was a terrific kid&#x2014;just like his family.&#x201D;\\n                  \\n                    \\n                \\n                  \\n                    \\n                \\n                It was to be one of the last happy times the family would share. Just three weeks later, on May 14, the bodies of Amy, Savvas, Philip and the family&#x2019;s housekeeper Veralicia Figueroa were found in their $4.5 million mansion near the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. The quadruple homicide&#x2014;discovered after the house was set ablaze&#x2014;shocked neighbors in the well-heeled Woodley Park community, where Amy, 47, and Savvas, the 46-year-old CEO of a lucrative construction firm, rubbed elbows with the Washington elite and were lauded for their warmth and generosity. (The couple&#x2019;s two daughters, Abigail and 16-year-old Katerina, were away at boarding school at the time of the killings.) &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t really grapple with anything like this,&#x201D; says Fireman. &#x201C;It is inconceivable. I cannot stop thinking about the family and what those last moments must have been like for them.&#x201D;\\n                  \\n                    \\n                \\n                  \\n                    \\n                \\n                As investigators began to reveal details of the case, a terrifying scenario came into view: The victims, authorities say, were held captive for more than 18 hours, and stab wounds suggest that Philip may have been tortured by one or more killers in order to get money from his wealthy father. &#x201C;Who would do something so monstrous?&#x201D; asks Jay Howard, Philip&#x2019;s racing coach. &#x201C;This was a nice family. Savvas would have done everything to protect them all. He would have given the thieves anything they wanted. He would have said, &#x2018;Take it.

The home&#x2019;s sophisticated security system had not been triggered, suggesting the perpetrators had knowledge of the house or had been willingly let in. Someone then ordered Domino&#x2019;s pizza, with the discarded crust containing critical DNA evidence. Within a week, authorities had arrested a suspect: Darron Dellon Dennis Wint, a 34-year-old, Guyana-born former Marine recruit who had previously done work for Savvas&#x2019;s firm, American Iron Works. He is charged with first-degree murder while armed. Authorities have said they don&#x2019;t believe Wint acted alone, and court documents raise questions about the changing story of an assistant who worked for Savvas and delivered $40,000 in cash to the property. The documents state the assistant first told investigators that he or she had been called by Savvas May 14 and asked to take an envelope containing the $40,000&#x2014;withdrawn from Savvas&#x2019;s account&#x2014;and leave it in the garage. Later, according to the documents, the assistant said the request had come from Savvas via text on May 13.\\n                  \\n                    \\n                \\n                  \\n                    \\n                \\n                \\n                  \\n                      \\n                      \\n                      \\n                        \\n                          \\n                        \\n                      \\n                      \\n                      \\n                          \\n                              \\n                          \\n                            \\n                          \\n                              \\n                          \\n                      \\n                      \\n                      \\n                        \\n                          Daron Dylon Wint\\n                          Oswego County Sheriff&apos;s Department\\n                        \\n                      \\n                  \\n                \\n                It appears that the four were killed shortly after the cash was delivered to the house on the morning of May 14.

The couple, who also supported research into childhood concussions after all three of their kids suffered head injuries in sports, attended an annual gathering at the White House for Greek Independence Day in 2014 and once hosted a fund-raiser for U.S. Senator Olympia Snowe at their home. &#x201C;Washington events are usually stiff, but their kids were right there,&#x201D; says Manatos. &#x201C;It was a clear sign that the kids were the center of their lives.&#x201D;\\n                  \\n                    \\n                \\n                  \\n                    \\n                \\n                \\n                  \\n                      \\n                      \\n                      \\n                        \\n                          \\n                        \\n                      \\n                      \\n                      \\n                          \\n                              \\n                          \\n                            \\n                          \\n                              \\n                          \\n                      \\n                      \\n                      \\n                        \\n                          Veralicia Figueroa\\n                        \\n                      \\n                  \\n                \\n                Respected by his employees and colleagues as a fair-minded boss, &#x201C;Savvas was a once-in-a-lifetime guy,&#x201D; says his longtime business associate Robert Hodge, with whom he founded a welding program to teach struggling workers a new trade. &#x201C;He was a brilliant man of impeccable character. He knew his employees and their families, and if someone was ill he would ask them about it.
